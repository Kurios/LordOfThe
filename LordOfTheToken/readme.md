Three Tokens for the Elven-kings under the sky,
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
One Tokenizer to rule them all, One Tokenizer to find them,
One Tokenizer to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
